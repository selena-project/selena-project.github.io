{"name":"SELENA","tagline":"Faithful Reproduction of Network Experiments, with the heart and the muscles of the XEN hypervisor.","body":"### Overview\r\n\r\nThe proliferation of cloud computing has compelled the research community to rethink fundamental aspects of network systems and architectures. However, the tools commonly used to evaluate new ideas have not kept abreast of the latest developments. Common simulation and emulation frameworks fail to provide scalability, fidelity, reproducibility and execute unmodified code, all at the same time.\r\n\r\nSELENA is novel network emulation framework built on top of Xen that, which offers fully reproducible experimentation via an automation framework and supports unmodified guest OSes. SELENA provides out-of-the-box compatibility with common applications and OS components, such as network stacks and filesystems. In order to faithfully emulate faster and larger networks, the platform enhances the XEN hypervisor with _time-dilation_ functionality, transparently slowing down time passage for guest operating systems. This enables hardware resource scalability for large and fast network experiments with high network and computational demands. Users can directly control the trade-off between fidelity and running-times via intuitive tuning knobs. \r\n\r\n### Usage \r\n\r\nTo appear together with the code release.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Material\r\n* **Faithful Reproduction of Network Experiments**, D.
